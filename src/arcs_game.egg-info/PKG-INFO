# Arcs

This package provides the framework to play a game of Arcs, Leder Games' board game designed by Cole Werhle and illustrated by Kyle Ferrin

## Rules

All rules can be found in the Arcs rulebook, located [here](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0106/0162/7706/files/Arcs_Base_Rulebook.pdf?)

## Notation

For ease of logging game actions, notation is being developed to describe actions. Suggestions to clarify/streamline are welcome!

### Suits

* Administration - Ad
* Aggression - Agg
* Construction - Con
* Mobilization - Mob

### Cards

Cards come in one of the four previously listed suits, and in the number range 1-7 (2-6 if a 2 or 3 player game).
Each number represents the value of the card, whcih will com before the suit. Examples of card notation include:

* 2 in Administration - 2Ad
* 5 in Construction - 5Con

### Map Locations

The board is divided into 6 **clusters**, each of which is numbered 1 to 6. In each cluster is four **systems**, which are made up of one **gate**
and three **planets**. Each planet contains a symbol used in the expansion that will also be used here for identification. Locations are identified by first their **cluster**
and then their system id, which uses letters as follows:

* Gate - G
* Triangle/ship symbol - T
* Crescent moon - C
* Hexagon - H

Thus: some examples of **systems** are:

* Fuel Planet in sector 4 - 4C
* Psionic planet in sector 2 - 2T
